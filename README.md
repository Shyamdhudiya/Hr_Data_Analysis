# 🧑‍💼 HR Data Analysis Project

This project involves exploring and analyzing an HR dataset to uncover key patterns and insights related to employee attrition and other HR-related metrics. The analysis includes data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and modeling using Python.

## 📁 Dataset

- **File Name**: `HR Data.csv`
- **Source**: Uploaded manually in the notebook
- **Description**: Contains employee records with various HR attributes like job role, monthly income, department, attrition status, and more.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

- Removed irrelevant columns: `EmployeeCount`, `EmployeeNumber`, `Over18`, and `StandardHours`.
- Trimmed white spaces in categorical columns.
- Checked and handled missing values and duplicates.

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The following visualizations were created:

- **Attrition Count Plot**: Overall attrition distribution.
- **Attrition by Department**: Attrition rate per department.
- **Monthly Income Distribution**: Income histogram with KDE.
- **Monthly Income vs Job Role**: Box plot by job roles.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Numeric feature correlations.
- **Attrition by Gender**: Male vs Female attrition.
- **Job Satisfaction vs Attrition**: Relationship between satisfaction and attrition.

---

## 💾 Cleaned Data

- The cleaned data is saved as: `HR_Data_Cleaned.csv`

---

## 🚀 Future Work

- Apply machine learning models to predict attrition.
- Perform feature importance and SHAP analysis.
- Deploy the model using a simple Flask web app or Streamlit dashboard.
